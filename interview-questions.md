# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameters are how you tell a function what kind of arguments to expect.

Researched answer: Parameters are the placeholders for the real values, or argumentws, that you pass to a function.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: A class is a blueprint for an object and can be instantiated as many times as needed.

Researched answer: Classes are templates for objects and can be used to create multiple objects, but unlike objects class support inheritance and polymorphism.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the process of repeating an action or set of actions on set a data.

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of repeating code a certain number of times, or while certain conditions are true, or until certain conditions are met.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Declarations of variables or functions are treated as if they were declared at the top of their scope, even if they were declared further down and can therefore be called before it is decalred. Importantly initializations are not hoisted, so variables that are called before they are declared must be initialized before they are called.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: The spread operator (...) can be applied to anything that is iterable to break it up into individual parts such as making an array of numbers into individual numbers or string of chracters into individual characters. This allows you to pass the individualized contents of an array or string to a function or variable without having to first split or join anything.

2. React: React is a JavaScript library focused on user interface. Importantly it is declaritive, which is supposed to make it easier to debug

3. JSX: JSX stands for JavaScript XML and is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows you to write JavaScript that looks like HTML and produces React elements.
